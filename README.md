In this project I developed a web 3.0 block chain application with help from Enyel Sequeira and Adrian Hajdin at JavaScript Mastery. The application allows users to connect their wallets and make transactions with ethereum.

I was able to learn and bolster my understanding on several important skills and concepts while creating this project such as solidity, tailwind, blockchain, smart contracts, and several more!
